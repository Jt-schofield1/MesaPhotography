# 🎨 HOMEPAGE REDESIGNED - PORTFOLIO SNEAK PEEK

## ✅ WHAT CHANGED:

### 🚫 **REMOVED:**
- ❌ Full portfolio grid (4 collection cards) - no longer on homepage
- ❌ Side-by-side Mesa photos section - spread out instead

### ✨ **ADDED:**

#### 1. **Portfolio Sneak Peek Section** (Instead of Full Grid)
- **Single featured image** (one of Mesa's best work)
- **Simple "View Full Portfolio →" link**
- **Clean presentation** - teases the portfolio without showing everything
- **Purpose**: Entices visitors to click through to the full portfolio page

#### 2. **Mesa's Photos - Spread Throughout Homepage**
- **Photo 1** (`extra.png`): Placed before "Your Story" section
  - White background section
  - Portrait aspect ratio (3:4)
  - Creates visual break and adds personality

- **Photo 2** (`extra2.png`): Placed before "How It Works" section
  - Cream background section
  - Portrait aspect ratio (3:4)
  - Adds human element throughout the page
