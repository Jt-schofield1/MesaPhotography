3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"

   ```
4. Vercel automatically deploys

### File Structure

Key files you'll edit:
```

â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx              # Home page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about/page.tsx        # About page

â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header.tsx            # Navigation

    â””â”€â”€ portfolio/            # Your photos
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"
Install Node.js (see Step 1)

### Images not loading
- Check filenames match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Ensure images are in correct folders
- Restart dev server (`Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev`)

### Port already in use
Someone's using port 3000. Try:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### Can't push to GitHub
1. Check you've added the remote:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
2. Ensure you're logged in to GitHub
3. Check repository permissions
