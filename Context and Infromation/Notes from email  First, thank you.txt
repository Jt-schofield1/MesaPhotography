Notes from email : First, thank you again for doing this, you da bomb bro. Just let me know when to Venmo you for domain.

I think overall thoughts are just sunny light airy. I attached my brand kit in the shared file on Google Drive. It had my mood board and color codes and fonts I use. Along with the icons I use as my ‘logo.’.

Also, I really like the phrase “Created to create.” I think I want that as my slogan?? Idk lol

Also, I want people to know my typical locations. I have on my instagram that I’m a NWPA Photographer but that “I’m typically on Lake Erie, Pymatuning Lake and everywhere in between.” I like that and I think I want to use it for website too.

Here are some websites I like the vibe of:

Erie, PA Wedding & Family Photographer
steveeelchynskiphoto.com
 (this is lowkey fancy and too dark for my liking but cool)

Ashlyn Taylor Photography
ashlyntaylorphoto.com
favicon.ico
(this one is a little boring but very similar to my vibe. i like it)


AI2A4101-scaled.jpeg
Amelia Marie Photography
ameliamariephoto.com
 (this one is cool too)





Also, I need to get a new headshot, but I put in the file what I’m working with for now lol. Hopefully that will change soon.

I’ve added my pricing in the shared file as well.

If I’m forgetting something, please let me know!
